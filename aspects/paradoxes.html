        The sense of truth in both statements helps shed light on Karma. Here's how:

    <ul>

        <li>This one will lead to the next equally unique and morally urgent lifetime.</li>
        <li>The quality of uniqueness opens the mind to the Joy and Beauty of the present.</li>
        <li>The same quality opens ones awareness to Love, to be wholly present and let the past die.</li>
    </ul>
